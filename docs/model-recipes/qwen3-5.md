## Introduction

The dense Qwen3.5 / Qwen3.8 checkpoints (`Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`,
`model_type=qwen3_5`) are hybrid decoders: 48 of the 64 layers of the 27B model are Gated
DeltaNet (GDN) linear attention with a fixed-size recurrent state per request, and every
fourth layer is full attention (24 query / 4 KV heads, head_dim 256, output gate, partial
rotary). This recipe serves the text tower; the vision tower and the MTP head are not loaded.

**Compatible model checkpoints:**

| Model | HuggingFace | Hardware | Quantization |
|-------|-------------|----------|--------------|
| Qwen3.8-27B | [Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B) | Trn2 (trn2.3xlarge, TP=4) | BF16, static FP8 |

> `Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B-FP8` uses 128x128 block weight scales with dynamic activation
> quantization, which Trn2 does not support. Serve the BF16 checkpoint and let the plugin
> quantize at load time (see [FP8](#fp8)).

## Serving

On a `trn2.3xlarge` (one Trainium2 chip, 4 logical NeuronCores with 24 GB HBM each):

```bash
MODEL=<path-to-checkpoint>/Qwen3.8-27B examples/vllm_neuron/models/qwen3_5/serve.sh
```

The script sets the required options:

- `--tensor-parallel-size 4`: every head count divides by 4 and each rank holds one KV head.
- `--gpu-memory-utilization 0.65` and `VLLM_NEURON_KV_GMU_BUDGET_CAP_FRACTION=0.15`: HBM is
  24 GB per logical core and the 27B weights take 13.5 GB per rank. A larger KV budget is
  filled with recurrent-state pages and the graph is rejected (`NCC_EVRF009`).
- `--no-enable-prefix-caching`: GDN layers have no reusable prefix state.
- `--limit-mm-per-prompt '{"image": 0, "video": 0}'`: text-only serving.

An offline example is in `examples/vllm_neuron/models/qwen3_5/run.py`.

### FP8

The plugin quantizes weights per tensor at load time (`scale = amax / 240`, values kept within
the Trn2 E4M3 range) and uses static activation scales from an offline calibration file:

| Module | FP8 | BF16 |
|---|---|---|
| MLP | gate, up, down | |
| Gated DeltaNet | `in_proj_qkv`, `in_proj_z`, `out_proj` | `in_proj_a`, `in_proj_b`, conv |
| Full attention | q / k / v (one scale per part), `o_proj` | output gate |

The output gate stays BF16: `sigmoid` turns small absolute errors on large negative gate
logits into large relative errors, and per-tensor FP8 on the gate raises the attention output
error from about 1% to about 10%.

```bash
python examples/vllm_neuron/models/qwen3_5/calibrate_fp8.py \
    --model <path-to-checkpoint>/Qwen3.8-27B --output fp8_act_amax.json
MODEL=<path-to-checkpoint>/Qwen3.8-27B FP8_SCALES=$PWD/fp8_act_amax.json \
    examples/vllm_neuron/models/qwen3_5/serve.sh
```

`KV_CACHE_DTYPE=fp8` (`--kv-cache-dtype fp8`) stores K and V in FP8 with unit scales (K is
post-QK-norm and bounded; values are clamped to the E4M3 range on write). On trn2.3xlarge at
`max_model_len` 2048 it raises KV capacity from about 61k to 70k tokens (recurrent-state pages
dominate the pool) and costs about 1 ms per token at batch 1.

Calibration runs the Hugging Face model on CPU (about 2 s per prompt for 27B; 124 GB host
RAM is sufficient). `neuron_config.modules_to_not_convert` keeps selected modules in BF16,
for example `["layers.30.linear_attn", "layers.59.mlp"]`. For prefills above 128 tokens the
FP8 MLP runs as two kernel calls over halves of the intermediate dimension, since the full
width exceeds the kernel's limit for this model.

### Compilation

`OPTLEVEL` (`--optimization-level`, default 1) and `HLO2TENSORIZER_OPTIONS` (`""` compiles the
whole graph instead of modular flow) are exposed by `serve.sh`. Measured in BF16 at
`max_model_len` 2048:

| Compile settings | TTFT | TPOT | Cold compile |
|---|---|---|---|
| `-O1`, modular flow (default) | 368 ms | 27.2 ms | 4 min |
| `-O3`, modular flow | 355 ms | 26.7 ms | 40 min |
| `-O3`, whole graph | 353 ms | 26.7 ms | 39 min |

## Performance

`trn2.3xlarge`, TP=4, batch 1, greedy, measured with
`examples/vllm_neuron/models/qwen3_5/benchmark_serve.py` (mean of 3 rounds after a warmup).

| Configuration | Prompt / output tokens | TTFT | TPOT |
|---|---|---|---|
| BF16, `max_model_len` 2048, prefill bucket 1024 | 1024 / 128 | 368 ms | 27.2 ms |
| FP8, `max_model_len` 2048, prefill bucket 1024 | 1024 / 128 | 395 ms | 21.8 ms |
| FP8 + FP8 KV cache, same | 1024 / 128 | 407 ms | 23.1 ms |


Cold compilation of the `max_model_len` 2048 configuration takes about 4 minutes in BF16 and
12 minutes in FP8, and is cached afterwards.

## Accuracy

Per-module outputs of the Neuron model (BF16, all 64 layers and the final norm) match the
Hugging Face reference with cosine similarity >= 0.9999. Static FP8 MLP outputs match the
BF16 reference with cosine similarity >= 0.998 per layer. Against the Hugging Face reference
on real activations, FP8 layer outputs have relative errors of 1-7% (GDN), 1-6% (MLP) and
1-2.5% (full attention). With all FP8 modules, greedy 64-token continuations of 12 prompts
match BF16 exactly for 3 prompts, with a mean identical prefix of 31 tokens; divergent
continuations remain coherent. A task-level evaluation is in progress (see [Roadmap](#roadmap)).

## Known limitations

- **Batch size 1 for the fused GDN decode kernel.** Larger decode batches fall back to the
  PyTorch GDN path.
- **Full-attention prefill falls back to PyTorch** when segmented prefill is active
  (`head_dim` 256 exceeds the segmented attention kernel's limit of 128).
- **`on_device_sampling_config.all_greedy` returns invalid token ids** with this model;
  use the default on-device sampling configuration.
- **`logprobs` requests fail.** The sampler output does not include top log-probabilities.

## Related work

[vllm-project/vllm-neuron#54](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm-neuron/pull/54) adds
Qwen3.5 dense support (2B and 27B) on the same release branch, derived from the Qwen3.5
port in [qingzwang/vllm-neuron](https://github.com/qingzwang/vllm-neuron). It established
the hybrid KV-cache-group plumbing for this plugin, the per-core HBM sizing for 27B
(`--gpu-memory-utilization 0.65`), the PyTorch fallback for head_dim 256 under segmented
prefill, and the latency methodology this recipe follows. This implementation was developed
in parallel on the same base and is measured against #54 as the reference:

| Same instance and client; 27B, TP=4, `max_model_len` 2048, 1024 / 128 tokens | #54 (BF16) | This implementation (BF16) | This implementation (FP8) |
|---|---|---|---|
| TTFT | 277 ms | 368 ms | 395 ms |
| TPOT | 48.6 ms | 27.2 ms | 21.8 ms |
| Cold compile | 37 min | 4 min | 12 min |

The decode and compile differences come from the GDN state-page layout and DMA pattern, the
fused NKI decode kernel, clearing recycled KV blocks in the runner rather than in the decode
graph, and compiling at the default optimization level with modular flow enabled. #54 has the
faster prefill: its prefill graph executes in 267 ms against 357 ms here, with more matmul
instructions, and the difference persists with this implementation compiled the same way
(`-O3`, whole graph). Both implementations replaced the power-series intra-chunk inverse with
blocked inversion after finding it unstable on device. The intent is to converge with #54
rather than to propose a competing implementation.

## Roadmap

Before this work is proposed upstream:

1. **FP8**: calibrated KV-cache scales, and accuracy-driven selection of layers kept in BF16.
2. **MTP**: the checkpoint's multi-token-prediction head for speculative decoding.
3. **End-to-end benchmark suite**: accuracy and serving benchmarks against the Hugging Face
   reference and #54, including [Aider Polyglot](https://github.com/Aider-AI/polyglot-benchmark)
   for code generation, plus latency and throughput sweeps over context length and batch size.
